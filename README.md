# HyperTyper

<p>HyperTyper is a simple GUI 2D game in which words fly across the screen from left to right. The user must type the<br>
complete word in order to make the words disappear. If the word touches the right side of the screen, a life is deducted.<br>
The user has a finite amount of lives, and the game ends when it reaches 0. The speed, number of lives, and length of <br>
each word vary depending on the level. There are currently 5 levels.</p>

##Personal Remarks

<p>This was a fun little project to practice object oriented programming with a bit of GUI and game logic. Being a first<br>
year computer science student I made do with the free time I had to develop this simple side project.</p>
